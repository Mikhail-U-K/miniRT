# miniRT
This is my first little raytracing
The goal of this project was to create your own raytracing algorithm on C.
So i made 5 simple geometrical shapes: a square, a triangle, a sphere, a plane and a cylinder.
Also light and shadows management was added.
To run my program you should first git clone it, then run make and at last compile it like this: ./miniRT scene.rt.
Program takes a map with figures as second argument.
To make sceenshot with .bmp extension write the following: ./miniRT scene.rt. --save(be careful not to write anything extra after --save).
I've made a couple of scenes to try for you.
